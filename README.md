This website displays 2 tapes on a dark background. The effect of 2 crossing caution tapes is intended to be suggested. One tape reads "CYBER," while the other reads "JETZT."

Upon each reload, the tapes are moved to a different random position. This is achieved using JavaScript. If JavaScript is disabled, a "standard version" is displayed, and the random positioning is disabled.

The "CYBER" tape is usually displayed above the "JETZT" tape. If the page is reloaded frequently enough, you will occasionally see the "JETZT" tape at the top as well. This is also handled with JavaScript.
